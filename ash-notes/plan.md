strategy

1. testing main branch updates against branch
2. directory structure
3. meta-understanding of hardware-to-software process (both open-source and proprietary)
4. step-by-step from beginning (setup & simple example) - find example with MLIR if possible (couldnt find example with MLIR)
5. explore an example project directory at a high-level now that i know the four sub-directory structure
